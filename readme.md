This is my cloud backup of my personal configuration files. Use at your own risk.

I reference my own file system(s) here, so you'll likely need to make some edits if you want it to work for you as well.

Make sure to separately download and install the following vim bundles:

    YouCompleteMe
    jshint2
    perlomni
	rainbow_parentheses
    syntastic
	vim-bracketed-paste
    vim-fireplace
    vim-javascript
